# 🌍 GLOBU

## Welcome to **GLOBU – Your Travel Story Web-App!**

**GLOBU** is a travel-sharing web application that allows users to share their travel experiences, browse posts by country, comment on others’ adventures, and discover hidden gems across the globe.

GLOBU offers a space to:

✈️ Create and publish travel posts with descriptions and images

📍 Filter and browse by country to discover hidden gems

📷 View user-uploaded travel photos

💡 Why I Built It:

As someone who loves travel and discovering new cultures, I wanted to build a space where people could easily share tips, places, and inspiration, and help each other plan better experiences.Unlike typical travel blogs or guide sites written by companies or influencers, GLOBU is built around real user experiences. Every traveler can:

- Share their trip stories

- Upload photos

- Add personal tips and highlights

- It’s by travelers, for travelers.
